# How to run
If you are interested to try out this project, all you need to do is to download this
repository and download all required libraries. Make sure to also [download](https://pytorch.org/) `pytroch 2.1.0` (if you do not have it yet) 
from official website (make sure you have `cuda 11.8` enabled).

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After this you are ready to run app from your IDE or console:
```shell
python ui.py
```

P.S. You don't need to train any model yourself in order to evaluate. This 
repository already have some pretrained model for you to check!

P.P.S. If you are interested in project details and model used, please check

# Repository structure

Repository have pretty simple structure:
* `.data/` - autogenerated folder with all your datasets
  * `.raw/<dataset_name>` - raw dataset files
  * `.intermediate/<dataset_name>` - preprocessed files
* `.checkpoints/` - autogenerated folder with all your checkpoints
  * `<model_type>/<checkpoint_name>` - checkpoints of model
* `.notebooks/` - folder with all my research notebooks
* `.reports/` - reports that describe my research workflow
